Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this thesis ventures fur- ther into surrogate modeling, emphasizing complex-valued Frequency Domain (FD) data characteristic of electromagnetic systems. Predicting moving resonance with high fidelity remains a crucial obstacle in surrogate model development. While previous efforts successfully employed circle fitting to model such data, yielding smoother parameter curves, limitations were encountered in achieving the desired smoothness of the curve, particularly when addressing the intricate behaviors of resonance. To advance this endeavor, this study explores alternative geometrical fit- ting techniques, including ellipse and spline fitting, to refine the surrogate modeling process. Despite rigorous attempts with these methods, the quest for an optimally smooth curve representation persisted. This thesis proposes a continuation of this investigation, seeking novel methodologies and adaptations in the surrogate model- ing framework that can embrace the complexity of the data. It was found that none of the techniques used to fit the data locally yielded the desired outcome, so another perspective needs to be implemented to find a better approach to resolving the prob- lem.
